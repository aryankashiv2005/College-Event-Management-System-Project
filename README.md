# College-Event-Management-System-Project:

The College Event Management System (CEMS) is an intuitive and efficient web-based platform designed to streamline the event planning, organization, and participation within an educational institution. The system serves three primary user roles: Administrators, Faculty/Coordinators, and Students/Participants. It provides a seamless interface for users to manage, register, participate in, and track events, while also ensuring smooth coordination between event organizers and participants.
